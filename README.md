# Project: PawMate

This project was conceived during a Web Development Bootcamp by Dr. Angela Yu, that created Tindog, an app inspired by the popular dating platform Tinder. Adding a playful twist, this app focuses on our furry friends â€“ dogs! Subsequently, **I've rebranded the project with a new name and logo**!

## What is PawMate?
With PawMate, dogs can have profiles, and "swipe right" to express interest in making new canine friends, setting up playdates, arranging walks, or finding a compatible mate for breeding purposes, PawMate ensures that every pup and their owner find exactly what they're looking for.

## Front-end development and UX/UI Design
PawMate project demonstrates not only technical proficiency in front-end development but also creativity and a keen understanding of user needs. 
I've developed entirely using Bootstrap and Flexbox, special attention was given to ensuring responsiveness across devices, guaranteeing a user experience regardless of screen size. This project exemplifies the power of combining solid development principles with with design sensibility.
In addition to that, through intuitive UI/UX, I've brought the concept to life, fortifying the potential app and setting the stage for its eventual realization.

### Colors
When thinking of colors that represent dogs, earthy tones often come to mind. One color that captures the essence of a dog is "rust." Rust resembles the warm, reddish-brown fur of many dog breeds, evoking a sense of warmth, companionship, and natural beauty. Additionally, shades of brown, tan, and cream are also commonly associated with dogs, as they reflect the colors found in their coats and the natural world. 
On the other hand, when it comes to conveying emotions of romance and love, certain colors stand out. Pink is often linked with dating, symbolizing sweetness, affection, and tenderness. Similarly, soft, warm colors like peach can evoke these feelings as well.

Considering these associations, I've chosen three types of colors for the website and app. **1:**`#CC685B` **2:**`#C2966C` **3:**`#A97246`
